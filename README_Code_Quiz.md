# Code_Quiz


## Description

Given only an example of a code quiz and desired functionality, I created a style.css, index.html, and script.js file that work together to produce the desired quiz.

## Process

### Thinking Through The Problem

The first step I took was to start pseudo-coding. I wanted to get my thought process down on paper and then attempt to write the code from there.




### index.html

1. I added a div to hold the quiz.
2. I added a button to submit the form.


### style.css




### script.js

1. I added an object to hold the quiz questions, their answer choices, and the correct answer.



## How To Contribute

As always suggestions are welcome. I have used the methods I have at hand at the moment, but there are many ways to get to the same end. There may be a more elegant way to write this code, and input is welcome.
