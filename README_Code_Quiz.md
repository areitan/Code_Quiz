# Code_Quiz


## Description

Given only an example of a code quiz and desired functionality, I created a style.css, index.html, and script.js file that work together to produce the desired quiz.

NOTE: Due to time constraints, I was not able to finish all of the coding for this project. It is a work in progress. It needs more styling added as well as some functionality.

## Process

### Thinking Through The Problem

1. The first step I took was to start pseudo-coding. I wanted to get my thought process down on paper and then attempt to write the code from there.
2. I used paper and pencil to draw out a flow chart showing my desired screens and the events I thought I needed to handle on and/or between them.


### index.html

1. Since the HTML file is the framework for the application, I thought it was logical to start there.
2. I played around with the layout several times to map out the pieces I thought I would need. 
3. Ultimately, I decided to add sections for each "screen" I wanted to show.


### style.css

1. I decided to wait to do much styling until the end, so at the beginning I only added very basic styling to the CSS file. Then for readability, I added more css as I went.
3. If there is time I would like to improve the styling.
4. Added class ```.hidden``` with  ```display: none``` to work together with the javescript and hide items when I didn't want them displayed.
5. Unortunately, I ran out of time to finish the styling.


### script.js

1. I made an outline of comments to help guide my process in creeating the javaScript I needed.
2. I was unable to finish all of the coding.
3. Added class ```.hidden``` to hide elements when I didn't want them to show.
4. This document is incomplete. I ran out of time and was unable to finish all of the functionality.
5. I still need to allow the user to view t heir score and submit theit initials, and to clear the time interval.


## How To Contribute

This is a work in progress. I ran out of time this week, so upgrades to this code are going to be left for another day. I still need to add in functionatlity for keeping score and storing user initials. There are certainly more elegant way to write this code, and input is welcome.
