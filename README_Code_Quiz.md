# Code_Quiz


## Description

Given only an example of a code quiz and desired functionality, I created a style.css, index.html, and script.js file that work together to produce the desired quiz.

NOTE: Due to time constraints, I was not able to finish all of the coding for this project. It is a work in progress. It needs more styling added as well as some functionality.

## Process

### Thinking Through The Problem

1. The first step I took was to start pseudo-coding. I wanted to get my thought process down on paper and then attempt to write the code from there.
2. I used paper and pencil to draw out a flow chart showing my desired screens and the events I thought I needed to handle on and/or between them.


### index.html

1. Since the HTML file is the framework for the application, I thought it was logical to start there.
2. I played around with several different layouts to map out the pieces I thought I would need. 
3. Ultimately, I decided to add sections for each "screen" I wanted to show.
4. I added id's and event listeners to the correct answer buttons in order to use them for scoring.


### style.css

1. I decided to wait to do much styling until the end, so at the beginning I only added very basic styling to the CSS file. Then for readability, I added more css as I went.
2. Added class ```.hidden``` with  ```display: none``` to work together with the javescript and hide items when I didn't want them displayed.
3. Unortunately, I ran out of time to finish the styling.


### script.js

1. I made an outline of comments to help guide my process in creeating the javaScript I needed.
2. I added a class ```.hidden``` and added it or removed it for elements to controls when they would display.
3. I used event listeners and functions to keep score and control the flow of questions.
4. This document is incomplete. I ran out of time and was unable to finish all of the functionality. I was unable to finish all of the coding.
5. I still need to allow the user to submit their initials and score, and to reduce the time interval for incorrect answers.
6. I left a couple of comments in this file for pieces I have yet to write.


## How To Contribute

This is a work in progress. I ran out of time this week, so upgrades to this code are going to be left for another day. I still need to add in functionatlity for storing user initials and score and displaying them. There are certainly more elegant way to write this code, and input is welcome.
