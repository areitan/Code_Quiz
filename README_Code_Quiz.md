## Process

### Thinking Through The Problem

The first step I took was to start pseudo-coding. I wanted to get my thought process down on paper and then attempt to write the code from there.




### index.html




### style.css




### script.js





## How To Contribute

As always suggestions are welcome. I have used the methods I have at hand at the moment, but there are many ways to get to the same end. There may be a more elegant way to write this code, and input is welcome.
