# Code_Quiz


## Description

Given only an example of a code quiz and desired functionality, I created a style.css, index.html, and script.js file that work together to produce the desired quiz.

## Process

### Thinking Through The Problem

The first step I took was to start pseudo-coding. I wanted to get my thought process down on paper and then attempt to write the code from there.

1. I used paper and pencil to draw out a flow chart showing my desired screens and the events I thought I needed to handle on and/or between them.




### index.html

1. Since the HTML file is the framework for the application, I thought it was logical to start there.
2. I played around with the layout to map out the pieces I thought I would need. 


### style.css

1. I decided to wait to do much styling as that isn't the main focus of this exercise, so at the beginning I only added very basic styling to the CSS file.
2. If there is time I would like to improve the styling.



### script.js

1. I added an object to hold the quiz questions, their answer choices, and the correct answer.



## How To Contribute

As always suggestions are welcome. I have used the methods I have at hand at the moment, but there are many ways to get to the same end. There may be a more elegant way to write this code, and input is welcome.
